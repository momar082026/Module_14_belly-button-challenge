JavaScript Visualizations

Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Project Overview

This project involves creating a web-based dashboard with the following features:

1. A Horizontal Bar Chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in an individualâ€™s sample.
2. A BubbleChart that plots the OTUs for each sample.
3. A Drop-Down Metadata Display showing key demographic information of the sample.

Final Project looks like the Following webpage:
